## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following key folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
|   â””â”€â”€ consts.js
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The components that make up the pages are in the `src/components/` directory.

The `src/content/blog` directory contains a collection of Markdown documents that are your blog posts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Variables to configure your site like your `SITE_TITE`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, `SITE_URL`, and `SEARCH_URL` are in the `src/consts.js` file.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
