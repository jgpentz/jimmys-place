## Starting My Masterâ€™s in Network Engineering

Thrilled to share that Iâ€™m just about one month into my Masterâ€™s in Network Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder! Iâ€™ve been told this is the best program of its kind in the world, and Iâ€™m already starting to see why. The co-directors, Dr. Levi Perigo and Professor Jose Santos, are at the forefront of the industry, and their collaboration with leaders across the field is truly inspiring. I feel honored to be part of a cohort that gets to learn directly from them.

As part of the program, I also joined a mentorship initiative pairing first-year students with second-years. Iâ€™m fortunate to have Atul Anand as my mentorâ€”his experience and support have already made a huge difference.

Balancing full-time work with a full load of graduate classes hasnâ€™t been easyâ€”there have already been more than a few late nights in the lab and poring over textbooksâ€”but the challenge has been invigorating. Itâ€™s sharpened my time management skills, kept me creative, and opened doors to new opportunities that Iâ€™m excited to explore.

For anyone considering going back to school, I encourage you to try a single class and see where it takes you, it might be the spark you need.

Grateful for this opportunity, and looking forward to sharing more updates along the way!
