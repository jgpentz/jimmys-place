## Starting My Master’s in Network Engineering

I’m just about one month into my Master’s in Network Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder! I’ve been told this is the best program of its kind in the world, and I’m already starting to see why. The co-directors, Dr. Levi Perigo and Professor Jose Santos, are at the forefront of the industry, and their collaboration with leaders across the field is truly inspiring. I feel honored to be part of a cohort that gets to learn directly from them.

As part of the program, I also joined a mentorship initiative pairing first-year students with second-years. I’m fortunate to have Atul Anand as my mentor—his experience and support have already made a huge difference.

Balancing full-time work with a full load of graduate classes hasn’t been easy—there have already been more than a few late nights in the lab and poring over textbooks—but the challenge has been invigorating. It’s sharpened my time management skills, kept me creative, and opened doors to new opportunities that I’m excited to explore.

For anyone considering going back to school, I encourage you to try a single class and see where it takes you, it might be the spark you need.

Grateful for this opportunity, and looking forward to sharing more updates along the way!
